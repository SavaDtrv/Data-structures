The program needs 2 external libraries to run at all. The links will be provided below.

dirent - https://github.com/tronkko/dirent/blob/master/include/dirent.h

md5 - https://bobobobo.wordpress.com/2010/10/17/md5-c-implementation/

md5.h (no cpp) is an old version of the current md5 you can find around the network, 
so it was hard to find.
